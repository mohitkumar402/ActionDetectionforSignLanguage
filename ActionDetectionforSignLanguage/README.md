# ActionDetectionforSignLanguage
Overview

Action Detection for Sign Language is a machine learning-based project that aims to recognize and detect sign language gestures from video input. The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify hand movements and gestures, enabling better communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

#Features

Real-time sign language gesture detection

Action recognition using deep learning models

Support for multiple sign languages

User-friendly interface for accessibility

#Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch

Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe

Model Architecture: CNN, LSTM, or Transformer-based models

Dataset: Publicly available sign language datasets (e.g., RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather, ASLLVD, or custom datasets)

#Installation
#

#dataset upload

you can add datasets either of your won or by downloading form kaggle 
i have added datasets of hello ,hii,i love you ,thanks etc.

#train module
during training of module you need to understand all keypoints and versions update like tensorflow and allsuitaible according to your data

after that the results will be displayed to you by showing hand gestures and matching results will be dsiplayed 

# Installation
#clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mohitkumar402/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage.git
cd ActionDetectionforSignLanguage

#Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download or prepare the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

#Train the model or use a pre-trained model:

python train.py  # For training
python detect.py  # For real-time detection

#Usage

Training a Model: Run train.py with appropriate dataset configurations.

Real-time Detection: Use detect.py to detect gestures in real-time using a webcam.

Custom Dataset: Modify config.yaml to add new datasets and retrain the model.

#Dataset

You can use existing sign language datasets or create your own by recording and labeling sign gestures. Supported dataset formats:

Videos (MP4, AVI, etc.)

Image sequences with keypoint annotations

CSV files for action labels

#Model Training

Preprocess the dataset and extract keypoints.

Train the model using CNN, RNN (LSTM), or Transformer-based architectures.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

Optimize for real-time performance and deploy the model.
